# ChatSharp 

ChatSharp is a chat application built with C# WPF, using .NET 7.0 framework and Visual Studio 2022. It allows users to chat with one another, create a profile, and verify their email address. The application uses Google's Firebase Backend as a Service for user authentication and Firebase's Realtime-Database to store user messages.


## How to Use

Upon launching the application, users will be greeted with a splash screen with a progress bar. They can then login, register, or reset their password on the respective pages.

After logging in, users can create a profile with their job position, email address, and social media information. They will need to verify their email address by clicking on a verification link sent to their email.

Users can then start chatting with one another by selecting a user from the list of contacts. Their messages will be stored in Firebase's Realtime-Database for security and scalability.
